step 1: first of all download the MY_TOH_GAME.CPP file.

step 2: Download Turbo C++ 3.1.exe (the one i uploaded) not any other version.so after finish reading this file you just go back and download

Turbo C++ 3.1.exe file i've uploaded here in my account..

step 3 : If you have downloaded win1064Turbo C++ 3.1.zip file instead of .exe extensions one from here then you must extraxt that zip file 

and you'll get Turbo C++ 3.1.exe from there..just double click on the exe file keep clicking next untill finish

step 4 : Do not install turbo c in any other directory.you must install in default directory.that means you must install it in c drive 


step 5 : Copy MY_TOH_GAME.CPP file you downloaded earlier and paste it into here " c>>Yogisoft>>TC>>BIN " paste the file in BIN folder.
that means you gotta go to your c drive then go to the Yogisoft folder Then go to the TC folder after that Go to the BIN folder and paste the MY_TOH_GAME.CPP
FILE right there

step 6 : Now open turbo c++ from your desktop then click "File" click on "Open" then in the search box you can simply write "MY_TOH_GAME.CPP"

and hit enter twice or you can manually search and find+ select that particular folder from there (that file is in BIN directory)

once you've selected the file just open it..then press f10 or ctrl+f10 or simply select run option using your mouse..hit enter twice or run the game
